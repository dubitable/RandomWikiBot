# Random WikiBot
Every day, this bot publishes a semi-random Wikipedia article to the [@random_wikibot](https://twitter.com/random_wikibot) account on Twitter. It's also immortal.
## How Does It Work?
This program is actually loosely based upon a game I used to play with my friends entitled "Wikipedia Speedrun". Due to the sheer amount of Wikipedia articles as well as the links present on each, it is possible to go from any article to another just by clicking links. The fastest to do so, usually concerning completely unrelated concepts, such as "Turkmenistan" to "Chicharrones", would win. The bot acts in a very similar way: for the first post, it requires a starting path, which I chose to be the "Wikipedia" article of Wikipedia. The program will then find the intro text, an image, and a link found on the page for the next article. The links that have already been done are stored in "links.txt", so that if you tweet once and stop the program, it will pick up where it left off. The articles are passed through a profanity check so that inappropriate material is not published. To publish it periodically, I used the "Tasks" system on PythonAnywhere so that I did not have to run the program locally. Thus, wikibot will continue publishing content until something I have not foreseen happens or the universe ends.
